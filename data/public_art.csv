1,Captain George Vancouver,1936,In place,"A full figure bronze statue of Captain George Vancouver stands on the north side of City Hall, pointing towards Vancouver harbour and holding a partially open scroll in his left hand. The figure commemorates the events of 1792, when Captain George, a representative of King George III of England, sailed into Burrard Inlet and charted the area.","A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in ""Roman bronze"". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. Matthews: ""Mr. Townley, the ""Sun"" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.""Townley: ""What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the ""home for incurable dogs"", or some other idiotic thing"".Matthews: ""Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the ""Sun"" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.""Townley: ""Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...""The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost. This sculpture is on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Inventory list and, as a proud homage to a great explorer, has stood the test of time.",Vancouver City Hall,453 West 12th Avenue,Mount Pleasant,49.26118500,-123.11391800,"North entrance, exterior, in front of stairs",Figure,bronze,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=1,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=1&ImageId=1,Barbara Cole,98

According to a brochure published by the Royal Bank, the 3 central panels represent various myths: In one, Raven disguises himself in the skin of a deer in order to steal fire from the humans (shown as small faces in the lower corners). In the second story, Raven goes through a hole in the sky to steal the sun. The image depicts the sun (central to the panel) clutched in his claws over the box he put it in. As the story goes, he dropped the box in his haste and that's how light came to the world. Other creatures (salmon and seal) are depicted around his wings. In the third panel, Raven attempts to capture a fish to eat. As the fish struggles to get away, his head becomes misshapen and that's how the bullhead fish came to be.

There are  silhouettes of objects like and axe, cross saw, chairs, etc, interspersed among the poles.  Rainforest was loaned to The Reach Gallery in Abbotsford as part of its exhibition on trees.","Rainforest was designed in response to a call for public outdoor sculptures to be constructed and exhibited at Expo ‘86 in Vancouver. The piece was fabricated in Vanier Park during the summer of 1986 where visitors were invited to watch the construction process and interact with the artist.  The piece primarily consists of numerous parallel steel pipes intended to provide the sense of driving rain. Attached to many of these angled rain-like elements are shorter smaller pipes producing a simplified tree forms.   Interspersed among the pipe components are various objects associated with forestry; a crosscut saw, a baseball bat, a ladder, a house, all set at the identical angle to the tree branches.The intention is to merge the visual sense of driving rain with trees and objects associated with forestry. Excessive repetition causes the piece to appear both chaotic and ordered.

21,Captain John Deighton (Gassy Jack),1970,In place,"This 6'6"" bronze figure standing on a barrel is prominently located in Gastown and commemorates the man for whom Gastown is named. Born in 1830, ""Gassy"" Jack Deighton was an adventurer who went to sea and was attracted by the gold rush in California and then in New Caledonia (now British Columbia). He didn't strike it rich and instead became a tax man and a steamboat pilot and later ran a saloon which is why he stands on a whiskey barrel. The Globe Saloon which stood on the site was reputedly built in 24 hours by the thirsty workers. (Vancouver Sun, April 7, 2001, H3) The nickname Gassy Jack came from the fact that he talked so much. (drawn from Old Vancouver Townsite Walking Tour, Footprints Community Art Project, 2001)",The sculpture was commissioned by Larry Killam and others interested in improving business in the Gastown area in the early 1970s.

46,Untitled (Sculpture),1973,Removed,"Seventy-four upright cedar blocks, 3'x3' each by varying heights from 2' to 17' and each set in a 6"" base. These timbers are set on end in a seemingly random pattern on six concrete pads in the middle of Granville Square and mostly enclosed within a 50 foot diameter circle of red tiles. The sculpture measures about 40 feet by 60 feet and is roughly in the shape of a cross.  Known as ""Phifer's Fountain"", this work was commissioned in 1973 by the CPR and Marathon Realty to address a plaza of which the zoning panel of the day said ""a truly `civic square', as the developers propose, should be more generous and festive in concept."" (Rezoning application, October 1968) This plaza was described in the 1969 development permit application as ""developed with trees, sitting area, fountain, grass mounds, architectural lighting, etc."" Somewhere along the line, the ""fountain"" turned into a 30 foot by 60 foot sculpture.""The CPR went to Washington State to find someone to design these columns of squared timber to represent, in abstract form, BC forests. The wood used would supply enough timber to build 10 homes."" (A Guide to Sculpture in Vancouver, Peggy Imredy, 1980)By 2002, some of these columns had deteriorated substantially and Marathon wanted to redevelop the plaza. Some effort was made to find a new home for this quintessential 70s work, with the artist choosing to give it to the interior community of Princeton, where it currently stands as the gateway to the Trans Canada Trail. http://town.princeton.bc.ca/newpages/parksandrec/phifersfount.html#",,Granville Square Plaza 200 (Downtown),North end of Granville Street (Downtown),Downtown,49.28883500,-123.11220000,Centre of plaza,Sculpture,Western red cedar,private,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=46,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=46&ImageId=38,,118

Water wells up in the centre of the flower and spills out over the stylized petals, falling from between the serrated points into the pool below. The full flower is visible from the apartments above. The lotus form honours the history of Chinese immigrants and their contribution to the railway and the industries around False Creek. Three black granite circles are inset into the white concrete around the pool.  These rings echo the Ring Gear on Pacific Boulevard. Skateboarders like to practice on the flat surfaces around the pool. The area is finished with trees and simple black granite benches.","The project, for me, was about space for public use where art would help shape, animate and give meaning to that space.One of the underlying references is the many streams that once flowed into False Creek. The extension of the pavement above the water’s edge is meant to suggest this disappearance underground, to stir memory and history, while at the same time reinforcing the sense of the above ground space as a visually continuous promenade and plaza.The pond’s dominant feature, a circular granite sculpture sited in the center of the pond, is elevated above the grade of the paving so that a viewer (pedestrian or resident) can fully comprehend its form: a form that might suggest a flower, a wheel, a saw blade....This sculpture also has a spatial function to gather and hold energy as well as operating as a source of water for the pond. The three granite rings embedded in the concrete plaza reiterate the central well of the sculpture from which the water flows and activate the plaza plane. This plane is further activated by the stainless steel rings that echo both the shape of the pond ends as well as the wave movement of the water.As the pedestrian moves into the space the sound of the falling water becomes more dominant till the extraneous sounds of the street are entirely absorbed offering respite and perhaps an opportunity for further engagement and reflection.",Boathouse Mews,Between Davie Street & Coopers Mews,Downtown,49.27385700,-123.11755200,Pedestrian mews connecting Pacific Blvd. to Marinaside Crescent,Fountain,Black granite,Privately Owned,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=65,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=65&ImageId=50,,221

The overhead track ends at the False Creek side with a row of 5 wooden barrels lined up like on an assembly line. Below the barrels is a board walk of 12 segments.

97,Girl in a Wetsuit,1972,In place,"A life size bronze statue of a woman in a wetsuit, with flippers on her feet and her mask pushed up on her forehead, sits on a large intertidal boulder just offshore of Stanley Park.   In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown's initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location.  Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. ""When I couldn't get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled   right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers."" A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci's foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 8o feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. ""Girl in Wetsuit"" has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.","""I didn't believe we should have a copy of the mermaid (in Copenhagen harbour). She is rightfully a symbol of Copenhagen... I proposed to have a life-size scuba diver seated there. At that time scuba diving was getting quite popular here in Vancouver and, just as important, I didn't know of any similar sculpture anywhere in the world. It was a new idea…  There was tremendous opposition and great controversy. I still don't know why..""  (quoted in The Sculpture of Elek Imredy by Terry Nobel (publisher, Vancouver, 1993)  ""The sculpture (is) a symbolic figure of the future exploration of the continental shelf.""

Oppenheimer was an entrepreneur from Germany and served four 1-year terms as Mayor. He donated land for city parks and for the Rogers sugar refinery. The memorial committee planned to hire Augustus St. Gaudens to build a memorial gate to connect Stanley Park to the City in honour of Oppenheimer but they found out St. Gaudens was dead.  Charles Marega was new to Vancouver and had his first exhibition here with the Studio Club in October of 1909, showing small wax figures. Art critic Felix Penne (Francis Bursill) wrote in Vancouver World, ""These have the right feeling and directness of life and there is every indication the sculptor is capable of broader and more ambitious work - which I shall be glad to see.

Each side of the square is 15' long by 3'  high by 3' wide. The bottom side appears to be cut apart in the middle and the two parts wrenched apart to form a gate or arch.  The corten steel is designed so that the surface rust forms a protective coating.  There was some adverse reaction from Kits Point residents when the work was installed. Michael Duncan, Chief Curator of the Maritime Museum at the time, called it ""a bloody monstrosity."" An article in the Globe and Mail teased that it could be ""the world's largest paper clip."" The article (Mar3, 1981) also quoted from a city planning study which read: ""Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them.""  But the controversy soon abated and the piece has weathered time and opinion. It was vandalized on July 4th, 1988, when a field of white dots were painted on its surfaces -probably as an art ""intervention"". The dots were soon removed. Since then, the ""Gate to the Northwest Passage"" has become a familiar landmark, an important place marker which stands guard at the entrance to False Creek. The area around the site is a favorite for kite flyers.","The parameters for the juried competition operated by Parks Canada were to create ""a monument in Vanier Park to commemorate Captain George Vancouver,"" the first European to sail into Burrard Inlet, in 1792. The competition guidelines (1979) specified a sculpture made of permanent materials, ""not wood,"" and that it should not be in the likeness of a man. The form of the work takes off from two 18th century navigational instruments: the plane table and David's quadrant.  Chung Hung said that, ""The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast."" The piece frames English Bay from the north view and the Centennial Museum from the south view. The opportunity for a sculpture was offered to the city by Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs at the time. The project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  A five-member jury headed by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux selected Chung Hung's proposal from a local competition and the Parks Board approved the choice.

While I wished to contrast with the building's weight and greyness, and to amplify the theme of living growth represented in the tree plantings in the west half of the lobby, I also wanted the mural to be more than an appropriate decorative design. I wanted some image capable of appealing to the imagination of those who would use the lobby every day so that they would not tire of it and therefore become oblivious to it. What better than a great "" primavera "" for Spring to cheer the spirit? And what more impressive than a large sculptural relief in full colour? And what more poetically exuberant as a permanent symbol than two splendid butterflies breaking from the white cocoon of Spring - the one on the left an abstraction of pieces coming together to form the insect and the one on the right a full-fledged realization? It is hoped that once the mind is focussed in this direction a certain transformational process is suggested and with it certain mythological overtones might unfold. The cocoon may then become the violet and white mythic egg from which Spring is born.

There is a stylized cast lion on each corner of the roof. The square pavilion houses a map of Canada and  an image of one-legged runner Terry Fox by Ian Bateson etched into polished steel surfaces. The inscriptions commemorate Fox's heroic effort to run across Canada to raise funds for cancer research.  The ""Marathon of Hope"" eventually raised over $30m.","The miracle of Terry Fox was that he was an ordinary young man who turned his response to pain and loss into a triumph of hope and courage. When Terry lost his right leg to cancer in 1977 he decided to raise funds for cancer research. He would run across Canada and ask every Canadian to join the fight against cancer by donating one dollar. He began his Marathon of Hope in Newfoundland on April 12, 1980 heading for the Pacific and home 5,300 miles away. As he ran his daily 26 miles, the lone figure with the distinctive hop-and-skip gait became a symbol that captured the imagination of a nation.  On September 2, Terry was forced to abandon his run when cancer was discovered in his lung. That morning he had written 3,318 miles under the date in his diary. But the Marathon of Hope was not over.

By age 18 he became the first man to hold the record in both the 100 yard and the 100 metre runs. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he and his sister and their friend Paul Winn were the only black athletes in track in the Canadian National Championships. He ran in three Olympic competitions. In the 1960 Rome Olympics he collapsed on the track with a severely torn hamstring and was labeled a ""quitter"" by the press. He set another world record in 1962 but later had another fall when his left quadricep muscle group was completely severed.  After surgery and recovery he went on to win the Bronze medal in the 100 metre race at the Tokyo Olympics. Before his retirement in 1968 at 28, he established six world records. He was named BC's Athlete of the Century.  Afterwards he created manuals and sports programs for young people.

165,Marker of Change,1997,In place,"The monument consists of a 100' diameter circle of 14 pink granite benches each 5.5' long with a slight bowl in the top.  Each bench is inscribed with the name of one of the 14 women killed by a gunman on December 6th, 1989, at the l'Ecole Polytechnique, University of Montreal.  The benches are about the length and width of a woman's body and the depression in the center of each bench catches rain water, a reference to tears. A 98' diameter circle outside the benches is set w/ 500 7½"" square tiles with the names of donors.The circle is situated close to the center of the park and makes reference to ancient stone circles. The space inside the circle is slightly domed and covered with grass. An alter-like podium stands just outside the circles and bears the name of the piece and an inscription. Over time, Marker of Change has quietly asserted itself into the consciousness of the community and has become a site for individual reflection and meditation as well as a place of discovery."," It took nearly eight years for this monument to come into being. A committee was formed in conjunction with Capilano College and a subsequent national competition drew 98 entries. Toronto artist Beth Alber won with the design incorporating 14 pink granite benches in a circle.  It stands as a reminder of violence against women in society.  The competition policies state that, ""The Women's Monument is conceived as a rational monument to be located in Vancouver, BC, dedicated to all women who have been murdered by men, and naming the 14 women killed in Montreal on Dec 6,1989. It will provide a focus for healing and a tangible symbol of remembrance."" Beth Alber's artist proposal states,  ""The circle, the symbol used by women for centuries to represent a continuum, in a non-hierarchical way, is one of the major elements for this Women's Monument. It is a symbol of women's spirit and is associated with the idea of a protected or consecrated space.""  During the course of the project, considerable controversy was stirred up by the wording of the inscription which is dedicated to ""all women who have been murdered by men"".  Many people felt this inscription was too political. Some were critical about the eventual cost of the monument, approximately $500,000, which they felt could have been put to better purpose.  Many felt that the monument was too specific and was inappropriately sited in a public place, and that public money shouldn't be used to commemorate what was construed to be a private grief. But despite the obstacles, ""Marker of Change"" was unveiled in Thornton Park on December 6th, 1997 exactly eight years after the 14 women were killed.",Thornton Park,Main Street & Terminal,Strathcona,49.27401000,-123.09900000,Central area in front of the bus terminal,Site Work,Pink granite,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=165,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=165&ImageId=134,Barbara Cole,212

It was designed by Lew Parry and made into a sculpture, built by Neon Products, which was sited at the first Vancouver Air Terminal from 1939 to 1972 when it was scrapped because of rust. In 1985 the Vancouver Transportation Club and the Sheet Metal Workers Union 280 decided to build a replica to celebrate Vancouver's 100th birthday. They located Lew Parry and he still had the original plans. This time the rocketship was built from more durable materials by Terminal Sheet Metal and the Local 280 metal workers. The Rocket was exhibited at Expo 86 and then donated to the city. It was moved by helicopter to it's current site. A Centennial Time Capsule is housed in the base of the rocket, scheduled to be opened 50 years from 1986.

The most opportune time to accomplish this is before entering the Library - confronting the viewer by having them walk through the piece - and perhaps encouraging them to leave their previous perceptions at the door.The format in presenting the concept is another Leonardo da Vinci exercise - a geometric discovery of form, mathematics and order. Our interpretation of the exercise challenges the viewer's perceptions: first, by engaging the individual in a visual puzzle that defines the various elements of the geometry in a manner that also juggles their perceptions; and secondly, by making visual references to the cosmos that will take the viewer beyond the physical piece to consider the mysteries of the mind, universe, and of course, the search for truth.In locating the piece at, and as the entrance, it emphasizes Public Art as a functioning componenet of life and architecture - the concept challenging one's thought process and the physical statement aiding in the flow and function of the ordered architecture.",Renfrew Public Library, 2969 E. 22nd Avenue,Renfrew-Collingwood,49.25088500,-123.04224300,"Interior, front door",Site Work,"copper, aluminum, glass",City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=204,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=204&ImageId=170,,12;112

Yet what is watered grows; thus even an ancient ruins can initiate new life, as the unearthing of sculpture from an ancient Greece was seminal in issuing forth that springtime in Italy known as the Renaissance. This is not a fountain of youth but of time, old time reborn in the ever flowing spring of records of human endeavour.With the advent of the millenium at hand, reflections on the passing of time increase. The numbers observable in Fountain of Time (five, six, seven) reflect a countdown to the millenium: '95, '96 '97. In this context the fountain is a portrait of a certain reality of our time. Yet this particular reality (that of the twentieth century drawing to a close, and what that brings to mind), is only one of many many realities, relevent to those following the Gregorian calendar rather than for example the Islamic, Tibetan or Mayan calendars.

Hastings Park is at the base of the Hastings Street slope and in the middle of the Hastings community.  A grass slope provides a natural sunny amphitheater from which parents and supervisors can oversee the activities in the water park.  It was proposed that the slope be modified slightly and retained by a low 2' high concrete wall.  The surface treatment of the face of this retaining wall provided a prime opportunity for the integration of a community public art piece.  Water will be flowing out of the wall while the park is operating.  The artwork will add interest and animation to the play area during both on and off season months.  The artwork takes the form of a colourful file mosaic applied to the surface of the wall and could also incorporate metal inlays (eg. Brass, bronze, or copper to compliment and coordinate with the water spray heads).  The design of the artwork and the design of the waterplay area happened simultaneously to ensure the production an appropriate piece, unique to this particular site. - Park Board web site",Hastings Community Park,3096 East Hastings,DowntownEastside,49.28067400,-123.03489000,Water park,Mosaic,,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=306,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=306&ImageId=248,Nicole May,253

Walter raises questions related to the systems underlying the transactions and power-plays that constitute normal business in the world of real estate development. In Walter's art the museum without walls is also a museum OF walls, walls  new and old, as well as those walls that perpetuate economic class distinctions.

313,Milky Way,1999,In place,"Integrated into the public walkway through the Lions Developement at 1300 West Georgia, is a plaza incorporating fibre optic lights, mosaic swirls, and 3 large bronze castings of cargo ships seen from above. The lights, which are at grade level, define constellations in the night sky. The colorful swirls represent other galaxies and deep space objects, and the boats allude both to the actual cargo ships found in Vancouver's harbour and to mankind's use of the stars as navigation tools.     Kerr's sculpture was commissioned by the developer of the site after a competition sanctioned by the Vancouver Public Art Committee. It has been integrated into the public plaza/walkway that runs diagonally through the site from the corner of Alberni and Broughton to the corner of Jervis and Georgia.The work addresses pedestrian traffic through the walkway both during the day and as a completely different experience at night. It also allows opportunities for viewing the work from above from suites in the towers and from neighbouring towers.""Milky Way"" has four elements layered into the work. The first is 39 colorful mosaic spiral galaxies scattered across the site. The brilliantly colorful mosaic tiles stand in marked contrast to the second element, colored stone aggregate which has been laid down in large abstract fiels and which represent the ""cosmic sea"". The third element is 170 fibre optic point lights, in four different intensities, which represent the stars in 36 constellations. These ""stars"" are each set into a black granite star shaped tile and each constellation is further defined by lines of polished brass set into the aggregate. The last element is three large bronze castings of cargo ships, commonly seen in Vancouver's harbour - a fishing trawler, a tug and gravel barge, and a BC ferry - all seen from above.This work is both public and private, it welcomes both day and night viewing (in some sense providing its own light), and it enhances both public space and the developer's concerns for place making and site harmony. ""Milky Way"" is a successful example of Vancouver's public art program which has emphasized ""site specific"" public art instead of traditional sculpture.","""By day, a swirling mosaic paints the night sky beneath our footsteps.  By night, the ground plane disappears; a dazzling array of starlight guides our way.  We walk like giants through a carpet of lights, our footsteps stir the universe."" (From artists' proposal)""…There are four main elements layered into the work. First, 40 tile mosaics spiral across the site in 16 brilliant colours. Each design has been abstracted from photo images of actual galaxies. Then clusters of stars are created by 160 fibre optic points of light set in granite tiles which in turn are joined by polished brass dashed lines to define familiar constellations. The granite has been designed and laid out in four shapes reflecting four different starlight intensities. Third, alluding to humankind's historical fascination with navigation of the heavens, four large bronze castings of ships, icons familiar to Vancouver's harbours, are set at each port or threshold of entry - a fishing trawler, a gravel barge and tug, and an 18-foot long ferry. Finally, the 40 colour fields of stone aggregate, which overlay and unite all the elements, are abstractions of colour maps made of the Milky Ways' ""cosmic sea."" The recurring fours and forties and their multiples in the work refer to wholeness, totality, and completion (appropriate for a work completed at the end of the millennium).""

The piece was submerged for two years so that the surface would become encrusted with sea life. The sculpture was given a low-level electrical charge to attract crustaceans to its surface. Its position on the shoreline encourages the idea that it has washed up from the depths. For more information, cut and paste the following website address : http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/oca/publicart/webprojects/pdf/timetoppressrelease.pdf","""The inspiration for Time Top came from a comic strip by William Ritt and Clarence Gray called The Time Top that the artist read as a child. In it’s last episode, the Time Top was slowing down over the ocean . . . And the artist has picked up the story line from there and is presenting this sculpture as “a relic of reality, building on the idea of an alternative reality which we each share with a broad diversity. “ A comic book describing the artist’s creative and fabrication processes will be published to coincide with the opening event scheduled for early October 2006.After being fabricated out of silicon bronze by the Harman Foundry in Sechelt, BC, Time Top was submerged into the ocean water at Gibsons, BC for two years. While submerged, it was connected to an electrical power supply which delivered a low voltage charge to the bronze causing it to attract a deposition of seawater minerals on to it’s surface forming a crust. This process is known as “Electro-deposition of minerals in seawater” or accretion. When the accretion process was complete,the sculpture was fitted with a polycarbonate dome and now stands 13 feet tall and 10 feet wide. A series of granite cap stones, inscribed with images from the original comic strip, have been installed along the sea wall in front of the sculpture.

375,Right to the City,2004,In place,"""Right to the City"" involves three elements:  1) Ten resin capsules imbedded in the ground along the pathway at Nanaimo and 41st Avenue. The capsules contain paraphernalia that might be found in someone's purse or pocket.  2) Six metal door and window frames placed in a rectangle to evoke the structure of a house.    The doors and windows are made of HSS tubular steel, painted white.  The frames also have plates with possessive pronouns cut out of them: ours, yours, his, hers, mine, theirs.  3) Two weathervanes located on southeast and northwest corners of Clarendon and 45th Avenue.  The weathervanes are mounted on 12' poles.  They are comprised of a bearing assembly, a shaft  and a rectangular sign that turns in the wind with the words ""yours"" and ""ours"" cut out.   (from the Artists' Project Description)","Regarding the capsules:  ""Before this tract of land became part of the Ridgeway, there was a simple beaten path crossing the space.  We see this aspect of our project as a ghost-like trace of an ephemeral, unplanned path - memorializing something that is so much a part of everyday life that it almost escapes notice…""  ""We have marked out this path with ten clear resin capsules with objects cast into them.  The objects are things you would normally carry in your pockets: notes, bus tickets, loose change, etc."" Re door and window frames: Our intention is to raise questions around ideas of ownership of and entitlement to the city: whose city?  Do we feel the city belongs to us because it is 'public'?  Or do we think of entitlement in terms of private property: what we own or don't own?"" Regarding the weathervanes: ""The turning of the signs in the wind functions as metaphor for shifting notions of community, place, and a sense of entitlement we feel as citizens.""    ""The title ""Right to the City"" comes from the urban theorist Henri Lefebvre's text by the same name which calls for a different envisioning of the city: for it to be organized for, and belong to, its inhabitants, rather than organized for profit.  The elements in this project explore the contradictions and ambiguities of public and private space.  Although we can identify in general with Vancouver as 'our city', as belonging to the public, space in the city is clearly delineated: either it belong to you or id doesn't.  The space along Nanaimo is technically public space, and unlike the neighbouring yards, anyone can go on this space.  However, in the larger scheme of things, do we feel entitled to it as a space?  We're interested in drawing attention to the public nature of this space and the claims made on the city.  Related to these ideas, this artwork addresses the ephemeral, shifting nature of the site, both in terms of the physical environment and cultural priorities.  This area was once a vacant lot and is now a small park.  We hope the work will open up a space for contemplation and reconsideration on the meaning of these transitions.  This is a chance to look at the neighbourhood in another way, and by extension, the city.""

424,People Amongst the People,2008,In place,"These three beautifully carved red cedar portals are constructed to represent the traditional slant-roof style of Coast Salish architecture with carved welcome figures in the doorways. They are intended as a gesture of welcome to the traditional lands of the Coast Salish people of the area. The artworks reflect the history of these aboriginal people as well as the modern culture that still thrives. Three years in the making, the artworks were developed through collaboration with Coast Salish Arts; Vancouver Storyscapes (a City of Vancouver Social Planning project to encourage aboriginal people to share their stories through a variety of media); the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Watuth First Nations; and the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation.","Drawing on Coast Salish design elements, People Amongst the People’s three portals represent:                                                                                         1) Male and Female Welcome Figures - Framing the view at the east entrance to the site, these two upright figures greet visitors in a traditional Coast Salish gesture of welcome. Both figures wear Salish blankets incorporating weaving designs and a salmon motif. On the reverse side, the male has traditional design elements and the female has a motif influenced by Salish berry basket designs.                                                                                            2) Grandparents and Grandchildren Honoured - On the upright poles located southwest of the path an intertwined braid of hair links the three female faces of the grandparents pole, illustrating the powerful matrilineal ancestry of the Coast Salish. The abstract design on the back represents the salmon, once so plentiful in the area. The grandchildren pole pays tribute to the importance of the family bond. On the reverse side, a carved herring design reflects the living culture in the area as it has been transformed through history.                                                                                              3) Salish Dancer and Killer Whale - Visible from the seawall and park drive north, the third portal articulates the evolution of Salish design. A Coast Salish Dancer shows a human figure holding a sea serpent rattle and above it, the Thunderbird, the most powerful of all spirits and a symbol of protection. On the opposite face of the Dancer, tree roots connect us to the land, sea and sky.  The Killer Whale upright depicts five whales, each with a raven fin and salmon pectoral, representing the close link between humans and orcas. The Salish believe that when great chiefs die, they become killer whales.

428,Untitled,2008,In place,,"The ambition was to place an autonomous work into the chaos of downtown, with its traffic lights, signage, newspaper boxes, street lamps and traffic, that could sit independently from all of that - an anomalous and allusive object that would create its own context and exist on its own terms amidst the downtown swirl and still belong, while strongly suggesting otherness. In other words to be both part of yet separate from the surrounding architectural reality.The references are many yet suggest nothing to anchor the sculpture into a specific interpretation. The black and white bands of stone may recall 12th century Italian church architecture. The gold leafed spheres with the projecting necks are suggestive of the retorts of the medieval alchemists whose putative ambition was to transmute lead into gold. The gold forms also suggest the popular symbols of the male and female. In addition the tower or column elevates the gold objects and, by making them inaccessible, enhances their mystery. Resting lightly on the column in spite of their considerable mass, the scale and precarious position of the spheres imply the possibility of arrival from some unknown place and time to briefly alight before moving on - a suggestion of a mind or consciousness, of the anthropomorphic? Or the kinetic potential of a bird that briefly alights on a rooftop before flying on.The placing of real gold - which one usually finds in the sanctity of the church, in museums, or bank vaults - into the public realm is a means of acknowledging that there can be riches for public pleasure, treasure above ground for the eye to see and the spirit to ponder; a recognition that public art is, in every sense, an honouring of and a gifting to the community.",Cielo - Hastings and Bute (1205 W Hastings),1205 West Hastings Street,Downtown,,,Northwest corner of Hastings and Bute,Sculpture,Marble and gold leafed aluminum,Privately Owned,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=428,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=428&ImageId=342,,221
429,Plot,2008,In place,Granite grave cover commemorating the artist's performance of digging the grave. This project was made possible through support from Mountain View Cemetery and the British Columbia Arts Council.,"On August 29th, 2006, I dug a grave by hand from beginning to end at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver. This entire process, six hours and fifteen minutes, was captured on HD video in one continuous take. The static shot is composed from the side with the plot at the bottom of the frame. The video ends when I have completely disappeared from the frame and have stopped shoveling. This work was initially exhibited as a scale video projection at the Or Gallery, Vancouver, in February 2007. Along with the video, a scale photograph of the empty gravesite, taken from directly above, was exhibited. The proportions of the excavation (the standard dimensions of a gravesite) happen to be the same as a ‘tombstone’ or artwork label, typically found in gallery or museum exhibitions (one aspect of my job at the Vancouver Art Gallery was to produce such labels). This grave cover thus lists the artist’s name, biographical information, title, media, and date of the work. After its installation at the cemetery, the stone was photographed from the same perspective as the original photograph of the excavation. This photograph will be included in future presentations of the project.",Mountain View Cemetery,,RileyPark,,,"Masonic Section, Plot 28, Lot 9A (just north of 41st Avenue).

430,Weathervane,2008,In place,"Copper sculpture of the artist as the philosopher, Erasmus, seated backwards on a horse reading a book.","Riding high among the rooftops in Vancouver is an unusual sight that awaits the casual viewer looking upward from street to sky; a 58 inch-high bright copper sculpture of a historical-looking figure riding a lively horse with a ringleted mane, reading a book while sitting backwards. The figure faces the direction of the wind as indicated by the four directionals and the tipped arrow upon which it rests. Closer investigation reveals this to be Rodney Graham’s Weathervane sculpture, which depicts the artist dressed as 16th Century humanist and classical scholar, Erasmus. Absorbed in the solitary activity of reading, the figure is lost in thought and contemplation, not having to worry about where he is going or what lies ahead but, as Rodney Graham puts it, is able to ‘ponder on horseback’  moving forward but also looking backward, to the past.  Rodney Graham based the weathervane on a contemporary anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England circa 1510. Graham plays on the absurdism inherent in reading a philosophical treatise on human folly whilst riding on a horse backwards and continues his ongoing philosophical enquiry into cyclical and backward movement; like all his work it contains a complex narrative and is brimful of references: literary, philosophical, self-referential and art historical.  Rodney Graham’s poetic and humourous weathervane, helpfully indicating wind direction and compass points for any serious traveller who looks upward to contemplate the conditions for travel, continues his preoccupation with un-urgent journeying. Erasmus travels from Italy to England leisurely by horseback, the cowboy meanders gently off the beaten track, the buccaneer’s unknown voyage which has thrown him up on a “treasure island”, and the chemically-induced mental journeys that take place in the artist’s head, remind us even if we are not going anywhere in particular that ‘the trip is the thing’.(Rodney Graham in conversation with Iwona Blazwick, Director, Whitechapel Gallery, October 14th 20082 Rodney Graham in Rodney Graham, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London 2002 p.109)",Pomaria,"1455 Howe Street, Vancouver, B.C.

436,Double Blind,2008,In place,"Double Blind is a large-scale sculptural installation by Antonia Hirsch, commissioned for the atrium of the new Vancouver Community College’s Broadway Campus Phase One Expansion building. Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.Dome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College’s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing ‘insight’ into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360° view of the surrounding space.Double Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.This sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation’s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don’t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.On the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters. Though reproduced in a colour identical to that of the shirt and thereby nearly invisible, the characters are tangible. Conversely, the front of each shirt mirrors the installation’s graphic arrangement in reflective foil, yet these braille dots are entirely two-dimensional, visible, but not available through touch.",See 'Description of Work'.,Vancouver Community College: Broadway Campus,1120 East 7th Avenue,Mount Pleasant,49.26434400,-123.08080000,Building Interior: Atrium,Site Work,Mirrored acrylic domes,VCC,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=436,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=436&ImageId=350,Photo Technic,317

439,Sensory Maps of the City of Vancouver,2010,Removed,"Sensory Maps of Vancouver is a series of drawings that record the movement of city buses and reflect the experience of public transportation in the urban environment. The maps were made during one 24-hour period, during which the artist moved from one bus to another to cover as much of the city as possible. These maps were enlarged and displayed in bus shelter advertising spaces around Vancouver from January 25th until March 21st, 2010. Map legends included subjective and objective information about the rides: the bus; the driver and passengers; the number of stops; the exact times of travel; and the weather conditions.","“As the bus moves, the vibrations of the vehicle are translated through my hand onto the paper. Twenty bus routes, one train line and the Seabus are explored in the course of one day, in a marathon experience. One map drawing represents one ride. In gesture, these drawings evoke a traditional type of mapping; exploring, discovering and defining a territory through a physical journey.”In her work, Anna Ruth studies the meaning of boundary through the exploration of line. Her work is conceptual, minimalist and poetic. Line and two-dimensional texture are the base of her creation.

441,Monument for East Vancouver,2010,In place,Freestanding illuminated sculpture,"Monument For East Vancouver develops from a graffiti symbol that has circulated for several decades in East Vancouver.  It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.  The East Vancouver symbol is rendered as a 57 foot sculpture that lights up after dark, the word East and Van encircled by a cross delineation that seems to float all on its own.  The sculpture faces westward towards downtown, towards the centre.  It is an expression of hope and defiance.",,Clark Drive at East 6th Avenue,Grandview-Woodland,49.26542600,-123.07761300,North West Corner of Clark Drive,Sculpture,"Concrete, Steel, Aluminum, Impact Modified Acrylic, LED Illumination",City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=441,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=441&ImageId=765,Robert-Keziere,3

The Bike Tree is sited at Science World, close to the 2010 Olympics Athletes' Village. It sits at the confluence of three major cycle paths, including the city's premiere Central Valley Greenway. The Solar Bike Tree replaces a street lamp at the end of an arc of large trees in planters, becoming one of the “trees” in effect.

(Temporary Project)4. Sandwich Boards: Metal sandwich boards painted bright colours with Instant Coffee slogans painted on the front and back. (Permanent Sculptures)","As part of Instant Coffee's self-proclaimed “Year of Bright Days,” the exhibit, A Bright Future was a four part public commission for ""88 BLOCKS Art on Main"". Instant Coffee has a reclaimed aesthetic and a social intention that played out over the four components: Blanket Bus; Instant Coffee 500; Say Nothing in Bright Colours; and Instant Coffee Light Bar Bus Shelter. All the components functioned as short moments of reprieve as visual fields that are most typically reserved for advertising. Even though Instant Coffee often formally plays with the style of advertising it does so without a clear focused point of sale.For Blanket Bus, Instant Coffee re-positioned and re-scaled the typical hand crafted afghan blanket, wrapping five sides of an articulated bus with large realistic photo images of the blankets. With its erratic and saturated palette and its repetitive grid line and block form, this vernacular aesthetic of the afghan was synthetically ripe, easily appropriated from its modest domestic crafting place and resituated at a larger scale into a public space, one of advertising. Since the artist collective's inception in 2000, Instant Coffee has used language as part of their practice, designing slogans like ""it doesn't have to be good to be meaningful and ""get social or get lost."" It is through succinct catchphrases, which at times drip with the sincerity of self-help jargon, ring with the urgings of advertising slogans or resound with a dissonant irony, that Instant Coffee applies to Say Nothing in Bright Colours, a series of seven individually hand painted sandwich boards that will be permanently installed in various locations along Main St in Vancouver. Instant Coffee often invites other artists to participate in their projects and they continued this tradition for Instant Coffee 500, where they asked 14 artists to design 16 interior car ad cards to be displayed in one bus. Instant Coffee then asked bus patrons to vote on which artist ad card they like best. For two weeks, transit riders voted on their favorite design via text messaging and online.  The winning artist received a $500.00 prize and their design was featured on the outside of another number three Main Street bus for the remainder of the project. For the Light Bar Bus Shelter, Instant Coffee adapted the Main and West 20th bus shelter into a full spectrum light therapy bar. In a place, such as Vancouver, Canada, with much darkness and rain, the negative effects from this lack of sunlight has on individual psyches and the larger social milieu seems at times seems paramount.

445,Aerodynamic Forms in Space,2010,In place,"A major figure in Canadian and international contemporary art, Vancouver artist Rodney Graham is well known for his conceptual and often humorous sculptures. His piece for the Georgia Street entrance to Stanley Park, a spectacular 400-hectare evergreen oasis in the downtown peninsula, is a 35 foot abstract stainless steel sculpture that replicates a balsa wood toy glider set; abstractly assembled as a modern sculpture. The work includes an impression of the twisted blue elastic band that would be used to power the glider, a propeller that slowly turns in the wind and wheels that whimsically bob.","The work takes its title from a series of photographs I shot in Vancouver in 1977…which documented a series of ‘incorrectly’ assembled toy glider kits…I put the models together not with a view to having them fly correctly, but with an eye to their aesthetic value as purely abstract sculptural forms… Part of the challenge inherent in making these works was the very limited instrumental set from which I had to draw.When I was asked to create a sculptural proposal for the entrance to Stanley Park, it occurred to me that it might be interesting to return to this work…and try to realize a large-scale version of one of these sculptures: to use the same very limited instrumental set with which anyone who has put together a toy glider would be familiar. The theme of flight seemed appropriate given the location too, for seaplanes are common sights at the entrance to the park.And the park, of course, is a place where children and adults may very well play with gliders… Plus it would be something that would be interesting when glimpsed only briefly by passengers in vehicles moving at relatively high speed along West Georgia.The title of the work is meant to evoke, in a slightly humorous way…that of a classical modernist public monument of a bygone period, elements of which the sculpture plays with.",Stanley Park,Georgia Street entrance,West End,49.29466700,-123.13608000,,Sculpture,,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=445,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=445&ImageId=769,,316

Specially uniformed kiosk attendants distributed what looked like conventional tourist postcards that actually had a die-cut hole in the centre, allowing visitors to frame their vistas in individual ways. The kiosk was both sculptural and practical and acted as a place from which to engage with people and the landscape in an otherwise frenetic environment. Visitors will have a chance to share their custom postcards by posting them to the Flickr group Vancouver Vancouver Vancouver and vancouvervancouvervancouver.com until the end of 2010.“The postcards are designed as do-it-yourself framing devices, and through them, one might view infinite vistas and recombinantversions of Vancouver, both here and elsewhere. Viewers candocument their “image within an image” and then post these on the website.” -- Vanessa Kwan","In the Fall of 2008, the City of Vancouver called for proposals for artistinitiated projects to be created during the 2010 Olympic Games. I ended up pitching this work, a three-part, temporary work called Vancouver Vancouver Vancouver. They liked it.The work is based on the postcard idea from my previous project, Your Private Sky-- postcards that could be used as hand-held frames-- but more specific to the Vancouver vista. The piece consists of 3 custom-made postcards, a roaming kiosk-sculpture that inhabited various sites during theOlympics, and a website where people could post images of the landscapes they had created.

Curated by Cate Rimmer, curator for the Charles H. Scott Gallery at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, the installation will feature six different exhibition programs during 2010.Walk In/Here You Are explores ideas of presentation and location. It invites visitors to interact with the installation’s physical components and to use it as an outdoor social space while viewing works by both established and emerging Vancouver artists.Part One of the exhibition explores themes that indirectly relate to the Olympic and Paralympic Games: spectacle, promotion, endurance, camaraderie and physicality. Artists include Stan Douglas, Jamie Hilder, Shannon Oksanen, Håvard Pedersen, Laura Piasta and David Catherall, Kevin Romaniuk, Jeremy Shaw and the performance group, Weekend Leisure (Erich Gerl, Curtis Grahauer, Christy Nyiri, Pietro Sammarco).","Walk In/Here You Are is a large-scale installation on the Central Library plaza that serves as a venue for visitors to engage with a curated program of projected videos and live performances.

The lights change with a computer programmed sequence.","THE WORDS DON’T FIT THE PICTURE is a text-based work made in response to the context, building and public surrounds of the Vancouver Public Library. The work takes the form of a large freestanding sign that sits in front of the VPL just off the southern entrance of the building in a heavy pedestrian traffic area. The sign takes its cues from an era of signage when signs were once seen as celebratory, grand and iconic – in effect, as landmarks in their own right as a kind of symbolic architecture (think: Caesars Palace, The Flamingo, The Stardust – to the landmark of all landmarks, Hollywood). In tracing this lineage, the work also acknowledges a local history when Vancouver was once seen as one of the neon-light capitals of North America. Reminders of this once past persists in signs like BOW-MAC “on Broadway” (now retro-fitted with the Toys R’ Us sign) and of course the W atop of what once was the Woodward’s building. In adopting the form of a sign, THE WORDS DON’T FIT THE PICTURE elides the classifications of traditional sculpture, by evoking a typology that is at once familiar and accessible. Taken within the context of a public library, the work touches upon – in a very poetic way – the use of words and language as boundless and imaginative, as a catalyst for a multiplicity of meanings.","Vancouver Public Library, Main Branch","350 West Georgia Street, Vancouver BC V6B 6B1",Downtown,49.27955200,-123.11645800,West Plaza,Sculpture,Aluminium,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=450,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=450&ImageId=1077,Karen Mills ,331

As a way of brightening the nights, adding to the sense of excitement and making the City visually remarkable, we developed three artistic lighting schemes for the City’s downtown core and Cambie Street.Fireworks Boulevard, a series of sequenced LED fireworks, chases down Cambie Street, transforming it into a grand entrance boulevard to the City. Vivid and unequivocally joyful, one can imagine watching the street lighting against a sky filled with actual fireworks.[Downtown] will be marked with a path of blue LED lights, which will feature animated rain sequences. In Yaletown, these cool-toned LED rain barrels will be complemented by a series of warm coloured flickering LED flames. The flames atop the lampposts will bring a touch of the Olympic Torch from BC Place Stadium, where it will be housed, outside to the city streets.

Afterwards calm is restored: The frozen light lines accentuate the horizontal, downwelling character of the building. The work refers to Vancouvers' special characteristic: a modern industrial city surrounded by wild and pristine nature.","My pieces are about concerns which play an important role in everyday life as well as in art, in painting, sculpture, architecture: space—movement—time—light. My pieces are not about that what we see, not about that what appears in front of our eyes but about that what is behind them, about that what presupposes seeing. My pieces in the urban environment, in a building or in the outer space do not exist without contact to their surroundings. They exist in a social and local context. This context is defined by the architectural surrounding, the architectural idea and the social situation: the co-operation of different historic, functional, organizational, visual, acoustic, tactile, communicative moments.The conditions of perception, orientation, movement and communication determine my thoughts about the situation and the development of an idea for the special place. So, my pieces refer to the place and the context, explore existing rooms, architecture, places, situations with different medias and react to the specific parameters of the surroundings:  the place—the situation—the function. On the other hand everyday moments and social connections play a role. I am interested in the specific site that the work exists in. My intention has been to change the nature of the public space. This space altered by my input, becomes the art. Light is my most preferred media I deal with because of its special quality. Light is a basic element. Without light there is no life. Besides, light is a very changeable element: Actually light—daylight and artificial light—exists in endlessly different versions. And light is a very ephemeral element; that's why I like it.

The work attempts to highlight both the lighter and graver sides of what can happen when a non-native species is introduced to an environment, how the beauty of birds can sometimes mask their threat tobiodiversity.","My work for the Olympic Village tries to infuse the ordinary andcommonplace sparrow with a touch of the ridiculous and the sublime. The Birds is a pair of sparrows (male and a female) that, through their large scale– they stand 18 feet tall (5.5 metres) – inverts the normal relationship existing between these typically small birds and the human population.Locating this artwork in an urban plaza not only highlights what has become the ‘natural’ environment of the sparrow, it also reinforces the ‘small' problem of introducing a foreign species and the subsequent havoc wreaked upon our ecosystems….

457,Flow,2009,In place,"Flow is Vancouver's first photo/media-based permanent public art work. Over the course of the day and night, Flow shifts between live and constructed or theatrical tableaus. During the early morning and after dusk Flow presents as a continuously changing tableau in which hundreds of photographic portraits and landscapes, shot by Fiona Bowie over the last few years, are blended and projected onto a special projection material (switch glass). As viewers come close to the image, this material causes portions of the imagery to disappear as panels of it's surface switch from translucent to clear. A system custom-designed by Bowie and Sidney Fels allows figures shot at different times to appear as if they simultaneously present, with a core group of these figures or actors recurring in a manner that implicitly suggests they're part of a larger narrative. The scenes in Flow change every two to four minutes. The transitions from one scene to another are so slow that the work has been described as having a dream like or hallucinatory quality. Because the project system constantly varies the scale of images (between life size and zoomed in), a particular shot of a particular character may vary from scene to scene, seemingly either fore-grounded or backgrounded. During daylight hours, Flow's dynamic glass projection surface ceates viewing portals, framing details the activity inside and outside. This provides individuals inside with shifting views and details of the street(these views change according to their proximity to the street) and passersby to view activity going on inside the building.The online component of Flow allows viewers to see the work unfold during the day when the site image projectors are off and the site glass is the active component. Visitors are encouraged to engage with the work by clicking on the ""Put words in our mouths"" link to play with dialogue and attribute phrases tocharacters pictured within the work.

471,Passage - Bright Light,2010,Removed,Sculptural light installation,"Access Gallery is pleased to present a new work by Osvaldo Yero as part of Bright Light: a temporary public art project commissioned by the City of Vancouver that involves fourteen local art organizations. Guest curated by Charo Neville, Passage is one of a series of cultural projects that will be on view through the months of February and March along the Carrall Street Greenway in the Downtown Eastside. Yero’s project will be visible from the street during the day through the window of Access Gallery.   Peering through a revealed slot in the otherwise darkened window the viewer will experience intense flashes of light, created by flickering LED lights which momentarily highlight knife blades set against a black backdrop in a completely darkened room. The brief beams of light on the spikes of metal suggest the reflection of light created from a lighthouse beacon, announcing a vast dark sea. Engaging the individual senses, yet disorientating the viewer and evoking the feeling of being alone in the middle of a dark ocean at night, the work offers a sense of solitude within the public space of the street. Its contrasting beauty and brutality also incites inevitable reflections about violence and self-preservation in the marginalized neighbourhood in which the work is situated.  As an immigrant to Canada from Cuba, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing Cuban diaspora. Since living in Canada, Yero still frequently visits his homeland, where many of his family and friends continue to live with limited possibilities to leave. Like the paradoxical freedom and panic that swimming in a wide dark ocean may induce, Cubans are legally bound to their country, which is both home and prison. Many who try to escape across the ocean do not survive, or arrive on the other side only to be returned. The metaphor of death prevails in Yero’s practice. The title of the work, Passage, reflects these ideas – water is evoked as the dual possibility of freedom and death.   This new work also addresses myriad issues of integration and dislocation facing immigrants to a new country. Exhibited during a global event promoting nationalistic pride through marketing terms such as “dream,” “discover,” and “celebrate,” the installation in turn speaks to the underlying complexities of these utopic ideals.   This project will also include a forthcoming exhibition catalogue, to be published by Access Gallery, in collaboration with the artist and the curator.",Access Gallery (Downtown Eastside),"206 Carrall Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2J1 (Downtown Eastside)",DowntownEastside,49.28298900,-123.10393400,Front window of gallery,Other,"LED lights, knives, enclosed room",City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=471,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=471&ImageId=379,,341

The security camera provides real-time surveillance of this audience and this surveillance is then projected into the Jeffrey Boone Gallery space.","We Are Watching, 2010 is a participatory video exhibition that teases ideas focused on public space, surveillance, public art policy and representational power. There are two components: a large-scale projection in public space, and an interior projection within the gallery fed by a live surveillance camera. By using participants’ video clips documenting the Vancouver 2010 Olympic, Paralympic and related events, viewers are asked to consider the ways in which the International Olympic Committee and the City of Vancouver is represented officially, and the alternative views that are largely dismissed, or written over, by the spectacle machine, which serves to homogenize the Canadian subjectivity. Issues explored are surveillance versus sousveillance, the ways in which we watch events, the ways in which we watch each other and the ways in which we are being watched.Participation consisted simply of video documenting the Olympic, Paralympic and Torch Relay events with cell phones (or any other video capturing device) and the clips were submitted by email and larger files were uploaded to an ftp site. The files were automatically pulled from the inbox and inserted into the video line-up at fifteen minute intervals. These clips were then projected onto the Gallery building, in a gated and locked courtyard, mimicing the inaccessibility of the Olympics. The people could gather on the sidewalk to watch the projection, and that area was monitored by the surveillance camera, which was projected on the wall in the gallery by a live. The gallery audience was essentially watching the audience outside watching the projection of the audience watching the Olympics. There is a two-part archival book project that accompanies the work and is available online at www.liddlethought.blogspot.com. The first part includes contextual texts by Kristina Lee Podesva and Danna Vajda  and images of the Torch Relay. The second part of the book will be available in April. It will function as an archive of the event as it unfolds over the time of the Olympic and Paralympic games. This book project will not only document the work, it will also function as a vehicle for the dissemination of the representations collected that provide an alternate view of the “official” versions sanctioned and circulated by VANOC and the City of Vancouver.

The work is a subtle reflection on the relationship between the natural and built environments.","Lines in architecture and art is a large photomural of a section of coastal landscape, focusing on the frieze of land where forest and water meet, commonly called the high-water mark or high tide line.  This naturally occurring, perfectly level line – made evident by the saltwater rising to the level of the overhanging trees, makes a natural reveal, a feature seen and used in architecture to visually divide the floor from the wall.En route from the north coast back to Vancouver, I developed the idea to create this large format photographic mural.  A reveal is typically the empty space at the bottom of a wall, where a measured gap is left so the floor and wall do not meet.  In this proposed photomural we will see how the saltwater rises twice a day, cutting an acutely accurate level in the tree boughs as they hang down from the forest landscape.  My interest was first drawn to this subtle occurrence when I realized the visual similarity to the architectural reveal, seen in homes, galleries and museums, a feature that is essential in the contextualizing and display of artwork.For this mural I decided to repeat the same photo three times in order to draw attention to the architectural references of this work and remove it from the genre of pure photographic documentation.Situated within the public sphere this proposed photomural presents a very simple meeting of land and water, highlighting how we draw from different ecosystems, the ocean and the forest, to simultaneously sustain our city.

500,River of Crows,2011,In place,"A two-block long mural on a tiered retaining wall, the final work gives animation and a colourful presence to a previously drab, grey concrete wall. Community involvement is evident in the overall spirit of the mural. River of Crows was initiated from the community, and reflects in rhythmic sequences, the daily migration of urban crows from night to sunrise and into daylight.","A community-based mural involving numerous experienced mural painters working with the local community, this mural was designed to visually engage pedestrians, cyclists and drivers along the McLean Bike route in and out of the city. For this reason, we collectively decided on a theme of migration, most specifically, the daily migration of crows. The mural suggests the almost mythic presence that crows hold for the population of Vancouver, a bird that has an iconic status in the city. As well, this theme reflects the daily human migration of commuters. Artistically, my challenge was to retain a poetic balance between representation and an underlying abstraction, giving the work an overall harmony and animation. In each of my mural projects, a focus is in the integration of the various elements.In coming up with the motifs, we incorporated about 40 large stencils, generated from small relief prints created in community sessions. This allowed for many individuals to take part, including three mentored youth. Elements are then repeated in differing combinations throughout. Some of the local architecture, including McLean Drive General Store, are referenced, and a large head of a crow in an aboriginal design respects the territory of Native peoples where this wall is located. Artists worked to integrate the upper wall, with the garden area and in particular, with the lower wall, which is made up a series of images from stencils and freehand of insects, plants and seed forms that are indigenous to the area. In all, forty-two people took part. The lower area of the mural was particularly well suited to youth participation, with some as young as three years old, and the oldest participant in his eighties. A set of videos were made of the process, as well as an extensive photo-documentation.","McLean Drive-retaining wall, Britannia High School",Between Williams and Parker Streets on McLean Drive,,,,West facing retaining wall,Mural,Acrylic latex on concrete,Vancouver School Board,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=500,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=500&ImageId=742,,148

502,West Pender Place,2011,In place,,This work was commissioned by Reliance Properties. The desire was to have an integrated light art work on the concrete cores of the two towers that would set apart the building and at the same time relate to its surroundings.The idea for the light installation was inspired by the natural surroundings.The city skyline holds a spectacular backdrop of mountains and water. But the work also responds to the architecture of the building which is constructed of glass all the way around apart from the concrete core. The two towers are connected by a lower section between them. The building is not rectangular but instead protrudes at different angles drawing diagonal lines in the glass facade. These angles can be seen as mountain peaks and they became the starting point for the light design. Led light lines were mounted on the concrete core horizontally. The lines reveal 40 different preset modes which have been uploaded to the rgb modules. One state is a graphic pattern of a single angle that meets up with angle of the building representing the sihouette of a mountain. This image remains the same but the colors change very gradually. The flow of the colors was inspired by the changes of the seasons and the changes of the day. They blend into each other with fades making the transitions look natural as part of the environment. The graphic state is sometimes intercepted by a dynamic state where a motion is simulated of water running down the building. The whole sequence takes more than 8 hours so it is not to be seen as a light show but more as a general presence.,West Pender Place,1499 West Pender Street,Downtown,,,,Other,,,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=502,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=502&ImageId=1061,,516

526,Infinite Tire,2012,In place,,"""Southwest and Southeast Marine drive has always loomed in my mind as Vancouver’s spookiest strip. Since childhood, every time I’ve driven down it, I’ve been creeped out by the scary 1930s and 1940s industrial structures to the south — by the endless repetitive loop of fast food and dead underwatered lawns, and by its overabundance of appallingly cheap commercial architecture. In my mind, when children die, their ghosts went to work inside those scary brick buildings. Inside the fast food joints, the fare was probably saltier and greasier than anywhere else, and if you went into one of the businesses or professional buildings, cults would hand you religious pamphlets, and when you left, your clothing would smell like your grandmother’s front hall cupboard and a moldy copy of Life magazine with Pat Nixon on the cover.I’ve been watching the strip’s ongoing redevelopment over the past decade, and while I’m glad it’s finally changing, I’ve been slightly unsure of what it’s changing into. The stores are now big and clean and shiny and no longer coma inducing — but maybe every time you buy something there, a penguin dies in Antarctica or a tree is chopped down up north, never to be replanted? Well, that’s just me being morbid. It’s now actually much better than it was before — the air of unipolar depression is gone — replaced by the early 21st century’s version of perfected retail, that of inventory-optimized big box shopping. The city has also kept what little good architecture there was and is making a definite attempt to green the place up. So when it came time to think of something for this location, I thought, ‘Why not revel in the consumer fantasia that is the Big Box?’  To do something earnest or minimal in the way that we expect public art to be seemed like a defeatist strategy. Anything sparse or overly cerebral would be optically clubbed to death by a staggering amount of colorful signage, and a chance to say something exciting or uplifting about the place would be lost in a possible miasma of jargon and Corten steel slabs.Canadian Tire is a store about possibilities; we all know the wonderful sense of creative omnipotence we feel walking down the aisles: Oh, the things I could do with those slats! And why, are those thin-veneer doors useful as tabletops? And look! An eight-can paint-shaker! We know the smell of fertilizer, plywood and galvanized nails. And we most of all know the smell of rubber tires — the smell of long-chain carbon molecules off-gassing in a way that no ventilation system can ever fight. And in Canadian Tire, the rubber you smell is possibly a Motomaster whitewall, and that’s what Infinite Tire is: a Brancusi-esque expression of joy in all things suburban, a wink to the notion of better living through abundance, and a totem of sorts that acknowledges and revels in the choices and creative freedom that can be inherent in industrial sizing systems."" - Douglas Coupland, 2012",Canadian Tire,26 South West Marine Drive,Marpole,,,,Sculpture,,,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=526,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=526&ImageId=702,Emma Peter,391

529,Geyser for Hillcrest Park,2012,In place,"There have long been rumours of underground water at the Hillcrest site, but Hillcrest Geyser arises from other hidden sources and pressures – the infrastructure of the new “green” water recycling system in the building. This public artwork is inspired by Old Faithful and other natural water spouts arising from geological pressures under the earth’s surface. A natural geyser is a spectacle that brings attention to what is going on below the surface of things. As a public monument, Geyser for Hillcrest Park replicates this sense of wonder and acts as a spontaneous reminder of underlying forces at work on the site. It is a civic “natural wonder” that makes the green initiatives of the building apparent for all to see. It is not a fountain that operates with a recycling pump. The Geyser acts according to the rhythms and needs of the community, as evidenced by the levels and flow of water through the site. The geyser spray is around 15 feet in height. The duration of the spray is determined by the amount of water needed to fill the tank. The run-off from the Geyser is connected to the grey water cistern in the Hillcrest facility. This cistern is used for all the building’s non-potable water needs, including flushing toilets and irrigation throughout the park grounds. The cistern is fed by collected rainwater from the roof and some grey water from underground sources. However, when the water in the cistern is low, it draws on the city’s drinkable water supply. This is where the Geyser comes in. It is incorporated into this water “loop"" so that clean potable water needed to top up the cistern will first be propelled out through the Geyser and then flow back to the cistern as grey water.","Because its eruptions are unpredictable and seemingly random, the artists believe the geyser will cultivate a sense of wonderment and play, attaining a reputation less like that of a civic monument and more like a mysterious element of the natural world.",Hillcrest Park,,RileyPark,49.24508400,-123.10707600,Northeast side of park,Site Work,,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=529,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=529&ImageId=709,Blaine Campbell,345;411

""Memento – Pink"" completely wrapped an articulated trolley in a knit cozy of a pink poodle and included an interior card inside the trolley that referenced a how-to book from the 1960s for making wool poodle cozies. ""Memento – Envy"", installed on the outside of a second trolley, was a panel which depicted a group of poodle cozies made for bottles looking with longing and jealousy at a porcelain poodle figurine - suggesting the class and cultural differences that historically have marked Main Street. This second trolley also featured three thematically related interior cards in which knit figures act as the dramatis personae.""Memento – Multo"", inside a third trolley, featured a set of twenty-two interior cards depicting over 100 different examples of the modest but culturally and aesthetically interesting objects that can be found in shops along Main’s 88 Blocks.","Memento is a response to the material culture that contributes so strongly to the character of Main Street. Main Street is more typically characterized by the presence of a multitude of objects that tend to have a personal meaning and relate to everyday life rather than high-end consumption. The poodle was chosen as a motif for the sculpture and other artworks in Memento because it is expressive of the general surroundings of the street. The poodle is not associated with a particular culture, and can therefore be enjoyed by a wide range of people along the street and in the surrounding neighbourhoods.

The salmon are shown as dark and mysterious…wild. The fish images are printed on sold Vinyl, while the borders are printed 50% grey on perforated Vinyl to provide commuters with unobstructed views to the outside of the station equal to 50% of the glass windows. (This was a safety requirement). When viewed from station's interior, the borders are clear. Viewed from outside, they are a semi-opaque grey. From the outside, viewers can see some movement of people travelling through the space to the stairs and escalators. Also, the feeling of the mural changes as the light conditions evolve with weather conditions and time of day, which tends to animate the piece, complimenting the captured movement of the fish and water. The mural panels are designed to utilize the structure of the glass panels and their support hardware as integral elements of the overall image structure. The City Centre Station mural is commissioned two times a year by the Public Art Program in partnership with InTransit BC's Canada Line Public Art Program.","""When I was first asked to submit a concept for a public art piece to be installed at the Canada Line Station entrance at the intersection of Georgia and Granville Street, I visited the site. Of course I knew beforehand what the function of the entrance was, with its stairs and escalators. But knowing about the function of something versus experiencing it firsthand are different. The first leads to an objective, factual kind of understanding, while the latter leads one to a more poetic understanding in which analogous connections can come to mind. Seeing the toing and froing of commuters going up and down the stairs and escalators brough to my mind remembered experiences of salmon migrating up the Campbell River and its tributaries and the eventual return of new, young salmon downstream to the ocean. Seeing that event left me unexpectedly, strongly affected. I wanted to see if I might be able to bring some aspect of it into my work. So I began making a series of photographs at the Capilano Hatchery in North Vancouver. When the City of Vancouver Public Art Department approached me regarding the creation of a public artwork, I was in the early stages of collecting images of Salmon. But I had not yet reached a decision on how I would eventually employ these images. The Canada Line project brought this into focus for me. I wanted whatever image I created for the Canada Line Station entrance to have a strong connection to the function of the site as well as to life on the Coast of British Columbia. I wanted viewers to be able to recognize and appreciate these connections. Further to this, I hoped to trigger people’s thoughts about these wild creatures and how they have exerted such a powerful effect on the rhythm of life along our coast throughout living memory as well as long before that. They have always been central in our cultures and economies. I chose to represent the salmon swimming within a structure that recreates the look of a fish ladder rather than attempting to show them swimming in the wild. I believe this allows viewers to connect my image to the structure and function of the Canada Line entrance, hopefully in a whimsical way. However, the image structure is also meant to allude to our processes for studying the life cycle of salmon, controlling and promoting the continued, healthy reproduction of their various wild species, and ensuring continued future harvests.These fish are full of vitality and a sense of undeterred purpose in the face of all obstacles. They are powerful swimmers that remain wild and mysterious, even when they find themselves channeled through our systems. I have tried to express some of these qualities by catching their images in moments when they are highly animated, swimming through turbulent water filled with swirling bubbles, their bodies dark and unknowable in their watery element."" - Jim Breukelman, 2013",Canada Line Vancouver City Centre Stn (Downtown),Georgia and Granville (Downtown),,,,North West Corner,Mural,Solid Vinyl sheets - images; Perforated Vinyl - image borders.

For this project, each daily cannon blast is symbolically dedicated to a cultural, social, or political figure or event in Vancouver or BC's history relevant to that date. The project acoustically memorializes the culture and politics that ground this history, towards imagining Vancouver as a socially and spatially just city.

573,Giants Among Us,2014,Removed,"'Giants Amoung Us"" explores monsters and giants from Northwest Coast indigenous oral history and how these stories relate to and parallel reconciliation and dealing with present day challenges.","Giants Among Us is my response to the role of reconciliation between Indigenous Peoples and Settlers to this land. Contained in the entire image are four separate scenes, which reflect narratives about monsters and giants based in oral history from the Central Coast. The themes to be taken away from these scenes are Protection, Escape, Rejection, and Balance.The image at the top is titled Raven Meets the Cannibal and the theme of this scene is Protection. The Raven in this scene is both human and bird figure. The Raven is known up and down the coast as a trickster, creator and hero or helper of the people. The figure to the right is known as Baxbaxwalanuksiwe or the Cannibal of the North Door. He is known for keeping humans captive and consuming them. This spirit of consumption can affect humans of all backgrounds. In this image the transformer Raven protects himself and returns the cannibalistic energy of greed and consumption back onto its purveyor. The second scene down depicts Escape. The captive child spirit has found his way out of the basket of the giantess known as the Atsi. Stories of this giant reach up and down the coast, and she goes by many names. My grandfather, Johnny Hanuse, called her “Skwanee.” She is known to steal unsuspecting children as they wander too far from the village. Often in the stories told about her, it is the most overlooked child who devises the plan to elude her. This piece was made to honour all of the Residential School child escapees. Over the years I have heard heroic stories of successful and attempted escapes from these schools, and many more fled within their imaginations. The children wanted to go home.The third scene down contains the story of Rejection. P'kvs also known as the Wildman of the Woods is a forest ghost who tries to charm the living into crossing over into the ghost world. He offers gifts, but they are not what they seem. I feel his spirit parallels many figures and entities we deal with in our world today. Many of us choose to cope with reality by accepting illusions, resulting in suffering and living as a ghost. This piece is a reminder to not fall into the false worlds or take in bad medicine.The final scene at the bottom is the Sisiutl, or double-headed sea serpent also known as Winalagalis. What I learn from this monster is the gift of choice and the need for Balance. The choice to build or destroy, and the choice to love or to hate. This serpent was still feared by many and consumed those who were weak in moral strength, but the greater message of the Sisiutl is that it is a choice to be weak or strong in spirit and mind.Although I have briefly described the scenes taking place, I also invite the viewer to construct their own narrative. When creating these designs I was conscious that children would be seeing them at bus stops. I wanted to create something that their imaginations could slip into. It is this ability to be free, to wonder, and to dream that was forcibly taken away by the Church and State-run Residential Schools, and it still a battle to hang on to our culture, languages and spiritual practice. I look to our stories for lessons on how to overcome the giants in our path.",Transit Shelter Ad Spaces,,,,,,Other,,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=573,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=573&ImageId=466,Amanda Strong,419

589,Fusion,2014,In place,"This sculpture sits in the heart of Marpole, one of Vancouver’s oldest residential neighbourhoods; it also sits on traditional Musqueam territory.  The Musqueam people have lived on their traditional territory – the land and waters now known as the lower mainland of BC encompassing the greater Vancouver region – for several thousands of years.  One of Musqueam’s most sacred sites, the Great Fraser Midden, is located just south of this site.The sculpture was conceived by the artist to acknowledge this rich cultural history, the history of the Coast Salish people, and to (re)introduce the residents of this community to their neighbour ~ the Musqueam people.The 14’ high water-jet cut aluminum sculpture, powder coated in copper and silver paint, is a contemporary Coast Salish design depicting salmon and river grass, which are representative of the Coast Salish people, and the Musqueam people in particular, and the salmon, once found in abundance in the nearby Fraser River.","“Fusion” is an artwork that marries mediums and cultures…as well as legends.  It also, metaphorically, fuses natural imagery with modern methods.The sculpture is contemporary yet unmistakably Salish.  As this development sits in traditional Musqueam territory and is close to the banks of the Fraser River, my conceptual art piece is based on the theme of “people of the Grass” as well as the “Salmon People” which is uniquely Musqueam.  The human element within the salmon has universal appeal that symbolically relates to all peoples.  The faces are revealed with traditional Salish elements.  Overall, the forms represent a living thriving culture and our historical legacy; as well as this unique community today…giving a sense of place and a landmark that respects the past, present and future.",Granville at 70th,70th Avenue & Cornish Street,Marpole,49.20855400,-123.14210000,"This work stands at the traffic diverter at 70th Avenue & Cornish Street, on the south side",Sculpture,Aluminum,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=589,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=589&ImageId=476,Ed White,300
591,Substation Pavilion,2014,In place,Concrete Pavilion,"Substation Pavilion consists of a small structure constructed of board-formed Ductal concrete, steel and glass, with a door that hints at a possible entrance (although in this case it is merely adecoy). There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouver’s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilion’s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvioussomething else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure?Substation Pavilion’s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of ‘reclaiming’ the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them,creating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus thatcontains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once ayear with its short-lived mushroom heads. It is a constantly shifting and ever-present narrative running just below the surface of the city.Cedric BomfordOctober, 2014",Meccanica,108 East 1st Avenue,Mount Pleasant,49.27002300,-123.10182000,South side of First Avenue,Sculpture,Ductal concrete,Cressey,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=591,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=591&ImageId=664,Michael Love,486
592,Elk for csnam,2015,Removed,"This work is to celebrate the history of the natural world and to remember that elk and other four leggings once lived on this exact site and that us the two legged’s should ponder our relations with the natural world. The work was commissioned by the City of Vancouver Public Art Program and produced for the Capture Photography Festival. Works for the Canada Line were in the context of the exhibition csnam: The City Before the City at the Museum of Vancouver, the Museum of Anthropology and the Musqueam Cultural Centre.","When asked to conceive an original work for this downtown site relating to the theme of csnam, the city before the city, Dana Claxton considered pre-colonial landscapes and animal nations such as elk, deer, bear, beaver, mink, raccoon, skunk and wolf populations that circulated through these lands by their own natural logic.  In particular, elk forms a crucial aspect of First Nations subsistence and spiritual economies. In the artist’s Lakota Sioux community they hold power as a source of sacred mana integral to ceremonial life. Elk were plentiful in the lower mainland for thousands of years, yet have disappeared in less than two hundred.  Today the local Musqueam people must trade up north and in the interior for elk, as their use remains intrinsic to the society and culture. The artist questions: “What does this mean for society today? How are we respecting the “four-leggeds” still among us? What is our relationship with them?  Who is responsible for considering them and making sure they are safe? How do we live with them?”  She asks us to ponder these questions as we look through the grey concrete forest to see the aestheticized elk, alive in a celebration of colour, where it once may have been standing.",Canada Line City Centre Station,West Georgia Street & Granville Street,Downtown,49.28259400,-123.11810000,,Other,Vinyl on glass,,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=592,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=592&ImageId=478,Cam Andrews,415

595,Land and Sea,2014,In place,"Contemporary Coast Salish designs come to life in two light boxes, over 4-storys each, installed on the copper facades facing inwards to the central plaza at 8555 Granville Street.   Designed by brother and sister team, artists Thom and Kelly Cannell, the panels tell a contemporary tale about their homeland, and depict creatures of the Land (green) and the Sea (blue).  Each light box is shaped as a fragment of a circle,  the shape of a spindle whorl which was utilized when spinning the yarn used in Coast Salish weaving.  (Examples of Musqueam weaving can be seen in the display case in front of the Safeway store along Granville street).  Creations in weaving have been passed down for countless generations.  The artists’ grandmother, Edna Grant, was taught to weave by her mother, who was taught by her mother, and so on. Her designs could be recognized up and down the coast.  Not unlike a crest, weaving designs symbolize lineage.  This is true in carving, weaving, painting, and dancing.  The artists are proud of this legacy and acknowledge it in this artwork.","""Land is usually depicted as steady and stable, Sea as unpredictable, and Sky as free spirited.""Our account of Land and Sea is a contemporary tale about our homeland. Legends have been thought about time immemorial and passed on from generation to generation. They are contemporary tales because the story is always changing. An Eagle’s spirit, or the spirit of a bear is not always the same thing. Different characteristics and different places mean different things. Kelly and I have created a contemporary design that demonstrates the way nature flows together. In some cases you will see water flowing down a stream, or the wind blowing through the trees, or the trees themselves and their underground roots.Land is: blades of grass, a deer is prancing through from the forest just for the fun of it. A beaver emerges through the reeds at shore, looking for another tree to chew down; he has found it, but is weary of predators all the time. This time, only small creatures of the forest are hidden.Sea is: the west coast dream. Killer whales are chasing salmon around the Salish Sea. Kelp is flowing in the currents, maybe it is herring spawning season. Flounders down below are oblivious to another world above the surface. Cod are hiding amongst the rocks waiting for an easy meal.Life is transient, hardly still, even though we don't see it, branches are deliberately growing, underwater habitats are being bathed with the tide and water vapors rise into the atmosphere to fall far away. Happenings are all around us, ready to be re-discovered again and again.The broken circle of each design element refers to fragmented spindle whorl artifacts and the separations we see between these elements. Only when we see the whole picture together will the circle be complete.

Musqueam elders advised that the small juvenile tree planted in the center should be the highly revered western red cedar.

642,RIPPLES,2016,Removed,"Nicolas Sassoon has created three digital abstractions using high contrast black and white animation. At first glance, these may seem like static on old tv sets. The artist plays with this association with the wave-like electrical interference of the past and explores the line between digital and organic patterns.  These allover screen patterns are meant to be immersive encounters with the digital realm while evoking the play of light and dark on the water and the hypnotic visual effect of rain and waves along the coast.","RIPPLES is a series of three screen-based animations created using a digital moiré technique. This animation technique is central to my practice; it consists in the overlapping of two images generating the illusion of a third image. Each work is produced using this method; two grids of pixels are overlapped and set in motion to generate a digital animated moiré.Alongside the use of digital moiré, the animations from RIPPLES display a common visual treatment: Streaks of hard-edged pixels combined to a minimal color palette. This visual treatment gives each animation unique graphical and kinetic qualities, reminiscent of early computer graphics and endemic to screens and matrix display technologies.The RIPPLES animations are initially shown on computer screens. They are published online as animated GIFs displayed full screen on HTML pages. The animations operate as seamless loops with no beginning or end; their duration online is determined by the viewer’s experience. Meanwhile, each animation encourages a contemplative gaze by combining textural and pixelated elements to a mesmerizing and infinite motion.Specifically, the animations from RIPPLES are informed by memories of rainstorm textures, sand patterns and ocean waves. Each animation attempts to emulate visual and behavioural qualities from these atmospheric elements into digital forms. This process happens slowly through a series of visual experimentations; when a visual experiment feels familiar with the natural references, it is developed to enhance and isolate these specific traits.The resulting works appear like distant recollections of the natural, fluctuating between organic form and digital abstraction. The space of the screen oscillates between depth and flatness, natural and synthetic, merging all into a hybrid form. The flat pixelated graphics flood the monitor, the endless motion does not give rest to the eye. The display becomes a reflecting pool; a space of contemplation on the presence and nature of screen technology.",Various Downtown Screens,,Downtown,49.28137400,-123.11970000,Robson & Granville Screen / CBC Plaza / VanCity Theatre / Telus Gardens Screen / Terry Fox Plaza Screen,Other,Digital video file,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=642,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=642&ImageId=503,Photo courtesy of the artist.,524

646,Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world,2016,Removed,"Vancouver Coastal pretends to be a travel guide book cover and a work of speculative storytelling. The image of jetsam washed up on the shore, supplemented by a visual quotation from a classical Japanese print, references contemporary nomadic life and the historic romanticism associated with it.Recent global events involving industrial and natural disasters, upheaval and migration, extreme weather patterns elsewhere and on our own West Coast shores leave an archaeological array of accidental artefacts washing up on shorelines along the Pacific.The shoreline is the point of transmission of cultures and objects and stories. Regardless of whether these stories are truth, fiction or somewhere in between, they nonetheless allow us to share our experiences.","“Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is the title of a text-and-image based work meant for installation at transit shelters. There is a certain fictional quality to the term “coastal city”, metaphorically on the verge of the imaginary, the otherworldly, the historic and the futuristic. “From a distance, the work mines the history of travel books from the early 19th century Baedekers to more recent and popular guides such as Lonely Planet and Frommers. While these guidebooks are meant as references for the worldly globetrotter, they nonetheless fulfill the desires of armchair vacationers and urban travellers alike. Upon closer inspection, one notes that the poster is a composite of two images. The smaller of the two images is an excerpt from a larger print, an ocean wave pattern from a woodblock print by Japanese ukiyo-e master Toyohara Kunichika (1835-1900) from a series of prints depicting shipwrecks. “Ukiyo” is a Japanese term meaning “the floating world”, a reference to the pleasure-seeking urban lifestyles of Edo-period Japan (1600-1867). The larger image is a photograph of Vancouver’s False Creek shoreline with objects introduced into the image. One might ask: what is an ikat fabric, a piece of imari-inspired china and a silvered cruciform-topped cruet stopper doing on the shoreline? And what could it all mean?Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is a work that references contemporary and historic nomadic life. Recent events involving travel, global weather patterns and natural occurrences in the Far East and our own West Coast shores have shown evidence of unexpected material and climactic exchange resulting in an archaeological array of accidental artefacts washing up on all shorelines along the Pacific. After all, cultural exchange is not limited to capitalistic trade. These artefacts are accidental travellers, nomadic ephemera that unwittingly influence our cultural landscape and a testimony to the independent life of objects. As the primordial ocean is the birthplace of life, the coastline is the threshold of humanity, our culture and our civilization. As the knowledge of our culture expands through the exchange of ideas, the history of trade can partly be told through the history of our coastline. From anecdotes predating the Galleon Trade1 to our present-day container cargo ships, our waterways and oceans tell the story of cultural exchange, some through trade while others through natural happenstance. “Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is both laden with truth and a work of fiction made possible through subjective and speculative storytelling. It epitomises how our coastline embodies our cultural makeup and experiences, and is a catalyst in triggering memories and starting conversations.

647,"Untitled, 2016",2016,Removed,"Ryan Peter’s images are created through a contact photo-printing process in which he uses acrylic paints, household chemicals, and industrial materials that would be considered waste, registering the traces on translucent plastic film. The resulting images have curious biomorphic associations, cryptically alluding to a distant past or dystopic future of life forms.Working with traditional silver gelatin printing, the artist explores shifting relationships between physical and digital processes and evokes the tension between the natural world and human-centered activities in the urban environment.For his Coastal City project, the images are toned in black, white and grey to create different “moods” related to life on the coast.","My project for Platforms 2015-17: Coastal City further develops two of my areas of interest: the shifting relationship between the digital and the physical, and the material, political, and ecological tension between the natural world and human-centered activities. Situated in a sensitive geographic location, Vancouver maintains environmental responsibilities that have both local and widespread implications. The material traces of these consequences—from remnants of foliage and forests to dried streams of water—are evoked in the work, through both production methods to the imagery and aesthetic. The project is an extension of my recent series of unique gelatin silver prints, titled Autograms. The work consists of reproductions of three Autograms resulting in three distinct posters. The project includes images varying in dominant tone (for instance, one that is largely white, one grey, and one black). Creating an overall mood for each poster, this dominant tone can be seen to represent time of day, weather condition, or season. These references to time and the natural world are echoed in both the material processes and compositions of the works. The biomorphic abstractions and “textures” are generated by contact printing acrylic paint on translucent plastic film, or utilizing materials that would typically be considered waste (polypropylene drop sheets, shipping packaging, etc.). This uneasy union between synthetic materials produces curiously natural results—the fractal forms are reminiscent of everything from rock formations to cedar bark. In this way, I see the works as a form of temporal excavation, resuscitating the organic ancestries of these petroleum products, even alluding to the networks of transportation and commerce required to procure the materials. These allusions to the distant past, and the pre-historic life forms that died to fuel the future, are complicated by references to more recent imaging technology, such as Photoshopped drop-shadows. As these works are made using a contact printing process, the prints are highly detailed and especially compatible with digital enlargement—their magnification revealing fractal forms not visible to the naked eye. Expanded to the size of transit shelter posters, the biomorphic ‘figures’ that populate my works approach human-scale, creating a unique form of engagement and experience. Particularly well suited to viewers in transit, the high contrast figure-ground compositions function as both graphically prominent from a distance, and visually complex on close viewing. This high fidelity fractal detail suggests the imagery of coastal scenery, while the ‘figures’, oscillating between plant-like and humanoid, point to the changing landscape as a consequence of human-centered activities. In this way, the works speak to Vancouver as both a coastal city and an important ecosystem, and allude to our responsibilities as we move within it.",Transit shelters around the city,,,,,20 Transit Shelter advertisement locations,Other,Inkjet printed backlit film,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=647,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=647&ImageId=1002,Ryan Peter,437

650,Tidal Pool,2016,Removed,"The film Tidal Pool by Curtis Grahauer represents New Brighton Park in Vancouver as a point of articulation between global industry and natural adaptation. The former salt marsh next to the Ironworker’s Memorial Bridge early on had a swimming pool that was filled by the tide.When the waters became polluted by industry, a new pool was built. Waterfowl adapted and settled in the pool through the winter months. Now there is an initiative to turn the edge back into a salt marsh.The film contemplates the site as a pivotal place of contestation between the natural and industrial forces of the coastal city.","In 1971, a health inspector deemed the water in the tidalpool located at New Brighton Park to be unsafe, due toindustrial pollution in the Burrard Inlet. A new pool was builtthe following year and continues to be open to the publicfrom May to September. For the rest of the year, the poolremains filled and waterfowl are allowed to use it, fencedoff and protected from human disturbance.As natural processes adapt around sites of conservation aswell as industrial sites, each one becomes naturalized initself, blurring the area between the natural and theartificial. The turning point of anthropogenic influence canbe seen as the moment at which an external dependencyoccurs, and environmental stewardship and conservationefforts to counteract the effects of industry are a primeexample of this. New Brighton Park has been an institutionof northeast Vancouver for over a century, but the parkitself is in a state of change. There has been a recentproposal to reclaim the shore and field next to and includingthe tennis courts, to transform this area back into a saltmarsh.The park’s location creates an ideal vantage point to framethe emblematic and historic aspects of Vancouver in thecontemporary moment.

651,The Journey,2016,Removed,"Kyla Mallett’s transit shelter posters for the Coastal City project take the form of quasi-inspirational posters created from altered new-age book covers referring to a certain ""West Coast New-Age"" culture.","The Journey is a public art series created for installation in Vancouver’s transit ad spaces for Platforms 2015-17: Coastal City. The five works in this series take the form of quasi-inspirational posters created from altered self-help and new-age book covers. Both the myth and experience of Vancouver as a ‘Coastal City’ connect with overarching ideas in Mallett’s practice; this new series of images is akin to her ongoing series Personhood, which pulls its imagery from covers of self-improvement texts popular in the ‘70s and ‘80s exploring the terrain of quasi-mysticism, personal empowerment, and commodity culture. Taking a form reminiscent of outdated posters, these works isolate elliptical statements on self-improvement and the nature of being in self-referential and critical ways. The Journey references what the artist describes as a ‘West Coast New-Age’ culture, with a specific focus on ideas of travel, movement, and transition. These works play with themes of ‘transit’ and the ‘Coastal City’ in direct response to the situation of the work in the transit shelter ad spaces around Vancouver, through alluding to this regionally specific ‘new-age’ sensibility as well as the commonly used metaphor of ‘the journey’ in self-help literature.The artist would like to thank Nigel Lew and Emiliano Sepulveda for their assistance in making this work.",Transit shelters around the city,,,,,Twenty transit shelter advertisement locations,Other,Ink on paper,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=651,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=651&ImageId=1001,Karen Henry,306

The bottom of the image shows this imperfect photographic illusion, a proxy of objective reality, that becomes increasingly abstracted towards the top. The abstraction is a proxy for the constructive powers of imagination and is the result of a machine learning process that rearranges colour values according to their similarity. The imaginary structure presented in this image is both an emergent composition and an exposition of the implicit structure of reality.

655,Golden Tree,2016,In place,,"""I remember growing up and seeing photos of redwood stumps in northern California, photos in which, “Wow! You can drive a car right through it!” I remember always thinking of what an affront to nature it was to use a car as a standard of bigness, but that was the early twentieth century. Later in the century, in 1995, I was in Ireland and phoning home for voicemail messages and had one from my mother that said, “Hi Dear, Constable So-and-so from the Vancouver Police phoned to ask if you’d deliberately left your VW parked inside the Hollow Tree in Stanley Park before you left and, to be honest, with you we never know, so could you give him a ring?” My car had been stolen from an underground parkade and abandoned in the tree by joyriders.     In 2006 Stanley Park’s Hollow Tree, an 800-year-old Western red cedar stump, was damaged in a particularly bad storm, and the City of Vancouver made a stab at removing it. I don’t know what they were thinking. Everyone in the city went crazy. The Hollow Tree is where people had their grad photos taken. It’s where they had their first kiss; it’s where everybody takes their relatives from overseas. In 2009 the Hollow Tree Conservation Society, funded entirely by private donations, stabilized the tree, and in October 2011 it was restored as well as possible, and made open to the public. I was pretty supportive of this project but years later I’m looking at the tree and I can see its days are numbered. It’s a piece of dead wood hundreds of years old. It’s rotting. It’s nature. So I wondered, “Why not transform the tree? Why not put it through a mirror and have it come out the other side as a mythical entity?” This is what I did with the Golden Tree at the corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street. It’s a mirror of something that once was — and will still be for a little while — and it establishes the existence of an evolving city that has an evolving sense of nature and ecosystems. It’s also located at the Canada Line Station, and I realize for many people coming to Vancouver, they’ll see the Golden Tree before they see the Hollow Tree, as if reading the chapters in a book in the wrong order, and isn’t that life?""",,8018 - 8198 Cambie,South Cambie,,,Corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street,Sculpture,,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=655,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=655&ImageId=1141,photo credit not available,391

715,Playtime,2016,In place,"Playtime is a family of sculptural forms that are located in the Family Commons along Heather Street and 30th Avenue, creating an inviting public space along the Wellness Walkway at the BC Children's Hospital and BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre. As 'play-sculptures' that combine modernist sculpture, mid-century playground designs, and monochrome patterns, these sensuous organic forms will invite a more physical engagement than is normally allowed with public art, providing occasions for children, families, and staff to play. The vision of the artists is to engage audiences of all ages and abilities with the sculptures' tactile qualities and lift their spirits with their humour and playfulness, creating a transition zone between the everyday and the extraordinary.Playtime is originally inspired by the 'play-sculptures' of English sculptor John Bridgeman (1916-2004) and Danish architect and sculptor Egon Moller-Nielsen (1915-1959), the work of Henry Moore, and two female artists, Barbara Hepworth (1903-1975) and Bridget Riley (1931-present), all of whom were producing works around the same time.","Our vision for this public art project focused on the idea that 'playtime"" is itself a transition zone between the everyday and the extraordinary. Our goal was to develop a collection of works that the children, families, staff and general public could play with as part of the Wellness Walkway.

717,The Wall at CBC: Picture Window,2016,In place,Diptych on a billboard,"Our homes are repositories for our memories. As our homes are renovated and changed over time, our memories of them are also overwritten. When a home is demolished, those repositories of lived experiences are destroyed. We may have mementos in the form of photographs of the space, maybe a home video, but the physical materials imbued with histories of deep, personal, human interactions disappear. When a physical vessel for memories is demolished, it weakens the memory itself – so how well do our memories survive as we are continually displaced, and our homes are eventually dismantled?In Picture window the artist’s hand is the hand of a labourer. The geometric pattern painted throughout this image is a found pattern from the home’s kitchen, where the stripe was painted on a cinderblock wall. It has been carefully carried throughout the home, touching every room, before going out the bedroom window. This line is transformed into a representation of the gaze of someone living in this house. It is positioned at head height and follows a line of view through the home, pausing where a piece of art once hung, then continuing out the window.At the same time, it is the line of gaze from outside the home into a bedroom. From embodiment to inhabiting, the life of a home is both an extension of the body and a microcosm of society at large. Who lived here in the past? What was their life like? Who will get to live here in the future, in the new home constructed on this site? Who designed and built these homes? Who cleaned and maintained them? What is lost with the demolition of the old home? What is gained by the building of the new home?

727,Listening. On. Waking Terrain.,2017,In place,,"Underneath Main and Terminal and extending back towards present-day Clark Drive existed a biologically rich lagoon and marsh area that was used by the Tsleil-Waututh, Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) and xmkym (Musqueam) Nations since time immemorial. The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother's Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxw’u7mesh artist/knowledge keepers T'uy'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces. I am grateful for their generosity of time and guidance.

736,All My Favorite People Are Animals,2017,In place,All my favorite people are Animals is a sliding door panel made of cast bronze that sits in front of a oneway mirror. The small area between the mirror and the door is lit during library opening hours.,"The artwork responds to the architectural and cultural context of the VPLs new nca mat ct Strathcona Branch Library. It aims to highlight a sense of community despite visible economic and cultural diversity of the neighbourhood. The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of “Head in the Hole” photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, nca mat ct, loosely translates as “we are one” in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as “one” across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of Head in hole photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character/animal, and see themselves within it. It is a sculptural activation of the imaginative process involved in reading. The holes provide the opportunity to see yourself in the mirror as the animal from a distance, or they invite you to peer inside.",VPL ncamat ct Strathcona Branch Library,730 East Hastings Street,Strathcona,,,Artwork is located in the front lobby on both sides of the wall area to the left of the front doors.,Site Work,Bronze and 1 way mirror,City of Vancouver,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=736,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=736&ImageId=1144,Blaine Campbell,411

750,The Wall at CBC: Excavations,2017,In place,"THE WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative. It is made possible by a partnership between Vancouver Heritage Foundation and CBC Radio-Canada, and is produced in partnership with the City of Vancouver Public Art Program. THE WALL features a new artist every year.","Excavations is a composite image made from numerous archival photographs of Vancouver, with the earliest images dating back to the 1880s. Elements from selected photographs were reconfigured to build an impossible architectural structure growing out of a landscape destroyed by logging. Excavations expresses the challenge of piecing together a complete history through the archive and its inherent biases, while also retaining the complexity of Vancouver’s history and ever-changing built environment.After reviewing a large selection of the city’s archival photographs, certain narratives around settlement and industry persisted in the historical documentation. Given Vancouver’s extensive pre-colonial, Indigenous history, questions regarding the under-represented communities and narratives in the archive informed the artist’s approach to producing the image. What history can be understood and given form when the archival material reflects a certain vantage point?Looking at the historical photographs, it is difficult to situate their locations within the city due to the dramatic changes that have occurred in Vancouver’s evolution from a frontier town to a major international hub. With the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, the development of the waterfront for Expo 86, the current housing bubble, amongst many other changes, the city of Vancouver is in constant flux. The majority, if not all, of the buildings used to create this image no longer exist, pointing to the disappearance of countless older properties, creating an historical amnesia. This explicit sense of disorientation and dislocation is represented in the destabilized structure of Excavations.",CBC Vancouver Broadcast Centre Plaza,700 Hamilton Street,Downtown,,,On the wall to the right of the main entrance of CBC Vancouver.,Mural,,Vancouver Heritage Foundation,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=750,https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=750&ImageId=1204,Michael Love,586
